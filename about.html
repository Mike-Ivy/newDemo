                <dd>
                    This class is for dogs that have no formal training. You and your dog will learn the basic skills that 
                    are needed to start to work together as a team. You will learn how to control your dog on a leash and 
                    have him or her obey simple commands such as sit, stay, down and come.
                </dd><br>
                <dt><u>Intermediate:</u></dt><br>
                <dd>
                    This class is for dogs that are 6 months or older and can respond to commands learned in Puppy Training, in Basic 
                    Obedience Training (Beginner Training) or Comparable Skill Level including Sit, Stay, Com, Wait for barriers, 
                    and Basic Leash Training. This 6-week class builds on the dog basic obedience course and continues to strengthen 
                    the training your dog has already received.
                </dd><br>
                <dt><u>Advanced:</u></dt><br>
                <dd>
                    This class goes above and beyond the basic training of commands like sit, down, stay, heel, and come, 
                    to high level competitions with the American Kennel Club and the Canadian Kennel Club. Throughout this course, 
                    we'll dive into the advanced world of dog training, first by starting off with a bit of dog training history 
                    and breed recognition, which will offer insight to breeds' intelligence. You'll also learn common advanced commands 
                    like stop, steady, back up, and give.
